# Teacher-Helping Application
## Description: 
We are designing an Android Application which is used for instructors and students. This app mainly for teachers which supports adding a new student to class or a department, make any changes in class timings, calculate CGPA of all students individually etc. There are mainly four activities. Profile activity which is used to check the student data and also for editing the existing student data and adding a new student data. Secondly, Attendance activity is for taking the attendance and storing in the database. Last, but one is Timetable activity which is basically used to set an event so that all the students can view it and attend that event on time. Finally, CGPA activity which is used to calculate the GPA of the students based on their grades. A database is used to store the data of all these activities.
